# Liquidity mining

Implementation of a simplfied version of a liquidity pool.

The set of smart contracts here mimick the functionning of a liquidity pool where user can deposit some undelying token in exchange of LP token that they can redeem later. On top of the LP tokens, users who deposit their tokens in the contract also earn some governance tokens. The number of governance tokens they receive is decided depending on the amount of undelying token they deposit and how long that amount was deposited in the pool.
