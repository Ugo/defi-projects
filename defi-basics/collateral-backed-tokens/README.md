# Collateral backed token

Example of a smart contract that is sending a collateral backed token (CBT) in exchange of some ERC20 tokens. The initial amount of ERC20 token can be redeemed when the user decides to withdraw his funds. The matching amount of CBT is then burnt. The ratio between the initial ERC20 token and the CBT token is here set to 1 but it could be modified to match a real case scenario.
